          <p> Both policy makers and researchers are finding that it takes more than just building a grocery store and stocking it with healthy food.</p>

          <h2>What you as an individual can do to help:</h2>
          <ul>
              <li>If you recognize that you are living in a food desert, you can start by helping those in your community understand what this means and talk about ways to make change. </li>
              <li>Discussing different options, such as growing your own food, working with local retailers to sell healthy, vegan foods, etc. is a good place to start. </li>
              <li>It is important to bring your ideas and concerns to policy makers—city councilmembers, state legislators, etc.</li>
              <li>Create petitions and have members of the community sign them to show support.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>What community leaders and businesses can do to help?</h2>
          <p>Community leaders and businesses need to team up to combat this problem. Grocery stores in low-income communities can’t markup the price of their goods because of the clientele they are serving. To continue to turn a profit, grocery stores need to expand their range of offerings and market the store as more of a community center.</p>

          <h2>Some key tips for a thriving grocery store in a food desert</h2>
          <p>Changing the diet of individuals doesn’t happen overnight. Instead of trying to do a sweeping change in area, consider making small changes</p>
          <ol>
              <li>Take extra time to hand-stack fruits and veggies into little pyramids — because it avoids bruising and it's eye-catching.</li>
              <li>Invest in skilled butchers, fishmongers and in-store chefs to prepare healthier food options that customers can smell inside the store (like fire-grilled chicken instead of fried chicken).</li>
              <li>Conduct research with community leaders to learn about their backgrounds and to offer selections that will appeal to the community your store (e.g. stores in communities with a larger Muslim population have a separate department for Halal meat.)</li>
              <li>Offer ingredients/items that your community is interested in, but are hard to find, in a hot-food section of your store.</li>
              <li>Substitute some ingredients in recipes for healthier alternatives (e.g. collard greens cooked with smoked turkey instead of pork, as a healthy touch)</li>
          </ol>
